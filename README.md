# CommPPO
About code:
hello.sumocfg, hello.rou, hello.net, hello.setting are the files for simulation in SUMO software.

About video:
In the video, the CommPPO algorithm is achieved based on the SUMO software. The red vehicle is the leading vehicle triggering an oscillation and blue vehicles are its following vehicles in a platoon. Two scenarios are presented for comparison, where the vehicle platoon is controlled by the car-following model in SUMO and the CommPPO, respectively.
