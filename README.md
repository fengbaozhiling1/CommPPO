# CommPPO

About video:
In the video, the CommPPO algorithm is achieved based on the SUMO software. The red vehicle is the leading vehicle triggering an oscillation and the green vehicles are its following vehicles in a platoon. Two scenarios are presented for comparison, where the vehicle platoon is controlled by the car-following model in SUMO and the CommPPO, respectively.
