About Video
In the video file, the CommPPO algorithm interacts with SUMO. The red vehicle is the leading vehicle triggering an oscillation and blue vehicles are its following vehicles in a platoon. Two scenarios are presented for comparison, where the vehicle platoon is controlled by the car-following model in SUMO and the CommPPO, respectively.
